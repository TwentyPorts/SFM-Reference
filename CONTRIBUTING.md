# Contributing

Feedback and contributions are always welcome! This is a small project but made with love, as cheesy as that sounds.

### Opening Issues

When describing a problem you encountered, please provide screenshots and steps to reproduce. You can also create suggestions here if you don't want to reach out to me directly; I don't mind.

### Adding Images

It is preferred that you contribute new images via the website's Submit form. If really necessary, you can also create a pull request with the correctly structured files, but any added images will still be manually reviewed.

To save space, the website only hosts JPEG images compressed to around 90% quality. All images must be correctly attributed to their original author and categorized appropriately.

### Contact

To reach out to me, either email <a href="mailto:2rayxu@gmail.com">2rayxu@gmail.com</a> or send a message to anyar on Discord. I'd love to hear any thoughts, feedback, etc. If you want your artwork taken down for whatever reason, this is also how you would do so.
