# SFM Reference

***Hosted here: https://twentyports.github.io/SFM-Reference/***

### Overview

SFM Reference is an artwork gallery for posters created using Source Filmmaker (SFM), Valve's 3D animation tool. It's organized around popular categories and types of art made by the community. As a whole, the project aims to serve as a point of reference or inspiration for SFM artists.

Current features include:

* Categorized artwork gallery

  * Tooltips/Descriptions accompanying each category

* Image carousel with:

  * Keyboard/Swipe navigation

  * Filtering by image tags
 
* Submission form

  * Users can contribute artwork for review

### Tech Stack

SFM Reference is built with React.js and Material UI components, and hosted on GitHub Pages. The backend service is hosted separately on AWS Lambda and sends data over to Firebase Storage.

### Sources

All images are publicly available, community-created artwork taken from platforms such as Reddit, the SFM Discord (mainly the
#starboard channel), Steam Community, etc. Credit is given to the original authors wherever possible, which means that I do not claim ownership over any of the art being shown.
