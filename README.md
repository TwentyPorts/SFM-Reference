# SFM Reference

SFM Reference is a categorized repository of artwork made using Source Filmmaker, meant to serve as a point of reference or inspiration for SFM
artists. More informally, it's a personal project for me to learn about ReactJS while also creating something hopefully interesting.

All images are publicly available, community-created artwork taken from platforms such as Reddit, the SFM Discord (mainly
#starboard), Steam Community, etc.

Feedback and contributions are always welcome! Please either email <a href="mailto:oracleofcake@gmail.com">oracleofcake@gmail.com</a>, DM Anyar#0380 on Discord, or make a PR/issue on the GitHub repo linked below. If you're adding new images, please make sure that all images are compressed to JPGs (i.e. no image should be larger than 15 MB), properly attributed to their author (with a link if possible) and categorized appropriately.

Likewise, if I made a mistake, or if you want your artwork taken down for whatever reason, please let me know.

Known issues: when you load a category, the website tries to load all the images at once. At the moment there aren't that many, but even then there's a noticeable time before every image will show up, especially with slower internet speed. Similarly, there's a noticeable delay when skipping a lot of page numbers at once. If the website were to include even more images in the future, this would become a big problem. Though, fixing this would require a fundamental reworking of how the image slideshows work in the backend.
