# SFM Reference

SFM Reference is a categorized repository of images for Source Filmmaker content, meant to serve as a point of reference or inspiration for the community's artists.

All images are publicly available, community-created artwork and attributed to their original authors wherever possible (which means that I do not claim ownership over any of the images used in this app). Images are taken from platforms such as Reddit, the SFM Discord (mainly #starboard), Steam Community, etc.

If you have any feedback or suggestions for new categories/images, please email oracleofcake@gmail.com or DM Anyar#0380 on Discord, or make a PR to the GitHub repo. Please make sure that all images are compressed and properly categorized (i.e. no image should be larger than 20 MB).
