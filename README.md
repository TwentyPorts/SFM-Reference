# SFM Reference

SFM Reference is a categorized repository of artwork made using Source Filmmaker, meant to serve as a point of reference or inspiration for SFM
artists. More informally, it's a personal project for me to learn about ReactJS while also creating something hopefully interesting.

All images are publicly available, community-created artwork taken from platforms such as Reddit, the SFM Discord (mainly
#starboard), Steam Community, etc. Credit is given to the original authors wherever possible (which means that I do not claim ownership over any of the art being shown).

Feedback and contributions are always welcome! Please either email <a href="mailto:oracleofcake@gmail.com">oracleofcake@gmail.com</a>, DM anyar on Discord, or make a PR/issue on the GitHub repo linked below. If you're adding new images, please make sure that all images are compressed to JPGs (i.e. no image should be larger than 15 MB), properly attributed to their author (with a link if possible) and categorized appropriately.

Likewise, if I made a mistake, or if you want your artwork taken down for whatever reason, please let me know.
